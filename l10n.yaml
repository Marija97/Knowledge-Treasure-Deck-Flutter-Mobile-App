# This file configures the localization tool. In this example, youâ€™ve done the following:
# Put the App Resource Bundle (.arb) input files in ${FLUTTER_PROJECT}/lib/l10n. The .arb provide localization resources for your app.
# Set the English template as app_en.arb.
# Told Flutter to generate localizations in the app_localizations.dart file.

arb-dir: lib/l10n
template-arb-file: app_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
untranslated-messages-file: desiredFileName.txt

# Preferred (fallback) locale, in case device locale is not supported.
# By default, gen-l10n sorts the supported locales in alphabetical order,
# this setting enables English to be the first supported locale.
